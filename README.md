## Requirements

  Install Python 3.9.0+ and the related dependencies using: 

  ``` bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1) Run the `main.py` file giving as input the path of the folder of the audio you want to analyse and extract the features to put them into a csv (choosing the output file name)

2) If you want to directly parse a test csv that I've conducted several experiments with, run `RandomClassifier.py`, it will parse the csv and the audio features giving as output 
  -the accuracy in recognising fake and real audio
  -a histogram (with the most relevant features of the analysed audio) 
  -a shap interaction values graph
  -a confusion matrix 

Example:

```bash
python RandomClassifier.py
Enter the file path (only csv): CSV/csv con LABEL/extracted_features_DEEP.csv
```
